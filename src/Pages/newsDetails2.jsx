            The HCB 48 Campeon, the newest and fastest model in the HCB fleet,
            has just won the coveted 2024 Miami International Boat Show
            Innovation Award. The Innovation Award, managed by the National
            Marine Manufacturers Association and judged by Boating Writers
            International, is one of the industry's most prestigious honors
            recognizing manufacturers who bring new, innovative products for the
            boating industry to market.

            “The HCB 48 Campeón takes the idea of the custom boat to a new level
            with an ultra-widescreen display that can be customized to the
            owner’s desires and a one-touch digital switching system that powers
            up only the systems specified by the skipper,” Gary Reich noted.
            “The build quality and attention to detail overshadowed entrants in
            the category.”

            Close, But No Trophy As the tournament drew to a close, and although
            they did not win, the HCB Yacht had made its mark on the northern
            Gulf fishing community. With its seamless blend of luxury,
            innovation, and power, it stood as a testament to HCB Yachts’
            commitment to excellence. Beyond this tournament’s stage, the HCB
            Speciale will continue to inspire and empower anglers to embark on
            their own adventures, cherishing the beauty of the seas while
            safeguarding its inhabitants. With their eyes on future tournaments,
            the AYG crew and their HCB Yacht will remain an emblem of
            excellence, a symbol of responsible sportfishing, and a beacon of
            hope for the preservation of our marine treasures.
